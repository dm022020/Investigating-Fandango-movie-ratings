# Investigating-Fandango-movie-ratings

Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator with a 5-star rating system on their website. Their rating range is between 0 stars and 5 stars. In October 2015, Walt Hickey (a data journalist) analyzed 8% of the ratings on the website and found that the ratings shown to users of the website are generally higher than the actual rating.

Fandango's officials claimed that this issue was caused by a bug in their system and promised to fix it as soon as possible. However, the acutal rating values are not shown in the HTML of their pages anymore and we can't tell if the issues has been fixed. To find out the answer, we are going to analyse the data on their movie ratings in 2016 and 2017 in this project. We will compare the data against the data in 2015 collected by Walt Hickey and see whether changes have been made in Fandagos's rating system since 2015.
